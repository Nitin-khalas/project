!!KEEP 	THE FOLLOWING POINTS IN MIND!!

//FOR SETTING up the Enviroment of CGI AND API =

Step.1:- Install Apache webserver, using pip install apcache..or yum install apache

Step 2:Webserver will give You two folders
	cd/var/www/html = put html file here..
	cd/var/www/cgi-bin = put python api file here.

step 3:Afer creating Html and python file.. make them executable , using chmod +x "file 	name". (This will turn , the colur of file from white to green)


//For RUNNING api and cgi prgm
Start the apachewebserver:- systemctl start httpd
Disable firewall of selinux= systemctl disable firewalld
			     setenforce 0	

		//FOR CREATING API [python program]=

add this on top:
#!/usr/bin/python3  = Program is run by browser so need to  tell browser , which 			      language we are using.

print("content-type:text/html")
print()				
				=Browsr send output to usr, so they need HEADER 					  content type.
import cgi
form=cgi.FieldStorage()
cmd=form.getvalue("VARIABLE NAME IN WHICH INPUT TAKEN IN HTML")
 = for taking input from html  and sending to python progm.


		//for creating HTML programs
1-Html whole  content is in between
<form>
<form>

2- For redirecting output of HTML to any other PYTHON page, use=
   <form action="url of that python page stored in cgi-bin foder">

3-for taking INPUT in html.. that is to create a box=
  USE= 	ENTER THE NAME : <input name ="x" type="text" />

4=for new line
	<br />
5 = to create a submit button, use <type = "AGREE">
